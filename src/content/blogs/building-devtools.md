# How to Build a Developer Tools Startup

Nicolas Dessaigne’s talk at Y Combinator Startup School focuses on building developer tools startups. He covers key topics like forming a founding team, choosing the right idea, building an MVP, go-to-market strategies, and selling to developers. He emphasizes the importance of learning quickly, launching early, and leveraging a developer-first approach in both product and marketing.

Here are the highlights:

1. **Founding Team**: Developers should lead, as they understand the audience and their needs. Non-technical co-founders aren’t a necessity.
2. **Idea Selection**: Runtime tools like APIs are critical and scalable, unlike build-time tools, which are often "nice-to-have."
3. **Building an MVP**: Build fast, prioritize iteration, and avoid overengineering.
4. **Sales & Marketing**: Founders must sell initially. Engage directly with developers and focus on community-driven, non-intrusive marketing.

## Key Takeaways

### Start Now, Iterate Quickly

Waiting for the perfect idea is a mistake. Build a quick prototype, even if it's rough. Nicolas recalls demoing Algolia to its first customer with just a command line and a basic webpage—and still closing a $2,000/month contract.

### Choose Scalable Ideas

Ideas tied to runtime (e.g., APIs like Stripe) tend to scale better as they’re critical to operations. Build-time ideas like QA tools can work but often face intense competition.

### Launch Early and Often

Use platforms like Hacker News to test your ideas and gather feedback. Nicolas mentions how companies like Segment and Ollama used repeated launches to fine-tune their products and gain traction.

### Engage Users Directly

Developers often avoid customer-facing roles, but Nicolas insists it’s critical. He shares how Stripe’s founders sat with customers, coded alongside them, and gathered invaluable feedback.

### Open Source Thoughtfully

Open source works well for frameworks and data-sensitive tools but needs a monetization plan, such as hosting or advanced features for enterprises.

### Developer-Centric Marketing

Documentation is marketing. Developers hate being "sold to," so prioritize clear, helpful resources and authentic community engagement.

### Founder-Led Sales

Early sales should come directly from founders. Nicolas notes that 74% of Y Combinator’s dev tool companies were founded by tech-only teams.

## Examples from the Talk

* Algolia’s MVP: Initially just a command-line tool and a simple search page, but it solved a niche problem effectively.
* Stripe’s Hands-On Support: Early Stripe founders personally implemented their tool for startups to ensure satisfaction.
* Hacker News Launch Success: Companies like Ollama and Segment gained momentum by showcasing their products on Hacker News and engaging with feedback.
